# Project 1: Brazilian January 8 insurrection
This is my first project for the <u>Lede Program 2023</u>, about the anti-democratic acts in Brazil on January 8 and how National Congress members discussed it on Twitter.

## Data
Data were collected with tools from the <a>Junkipedia project(https://www.junkipedia.org/)</a>. The main corpus consists of Brazilian Congresspeople's tweets – from the Brazilian House of Representatives and Senate –, published on January 8, 2023.

## Analysis
A basic lexical analysis was carried out, identifying key terms and the most used words in tweets. Word clouds were the main visual resource used.

## Limitations
Verifying the frequency and presence of lexicon in the corpus is an analytic method with limitations that must be disclaimed. First, it only allows a partial understanding of the meanings in the tweets, missing some nuances and intentions hidden in the content. It also doesn't capture the sentiments connected to the words. Performing a valence analysis could be a complement to deepen the corpus investigation.
